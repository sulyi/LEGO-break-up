   DESCRIPTION
-----------------

   This game features various shaped and coloured LEGO bricks.

   Game flow is not clear yet. There might be several levels where you'd disassemble a cube or some other way arranged LEGO bricks into pieces. Or could be that you'll be challenged to build a figure from given pieces.

   Still the # graphical engine # and some # data structures # are under development.

Check it out, later.

   INSTALLING
-----------------

   1. You'll need Python 2.7

   2. Some python packages: pygame, scipy and/or numpy and pyOpenGL

   3. That's all, you'd be able to run main.py
