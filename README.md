This game features various shaped and coloured LEGO bricks.
Game flow is not clear yet. There might be several levels where you'd disassemble a cube or some other way arranged LEGO bricks into pieces. Or it could be that you'll be challenged to build a figure from given pieces.

Right now,s still the graphical engine and data structures are under development.

Check it out, later.

INSTALLING

1. You'll need Python 2.7

2. Some python packages: pygame, scipy (aka numpy), pyOpenGL, pyOpenGL_accelerate

3. That's all run main.py
